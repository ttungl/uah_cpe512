1) Implement "hello, world" MPI, PThread, and OpenMP programs.

MPI output:
Hello World from MPI Process #0
Number of MPI Processes = 8
Hello World from MPI Process #1
Hello World from MPI Process #2
Hello World from MPI Process #3
Hello World from MPI Process #4
Hello World from MPI Process #5
Hello World from MPI Process #6
Hello World from MPI Process #7

PThread output:
Hello World, from PThread 0
Hello World, from PThread 1
Hello World, from PThread 3
Hello World, from PThread 6
Hello World, from PThread 4
Hello World, from PThread 5
Hello World, from PThread 7
Number of threads = 8
Hello World, from PThread 2

OpenMP output:
Hello World from thread = 1
Hello World from thread = 0
Hello World from thread = 2
Number of Threads = 8
Hello World from thread = 5
Hello World from thread = 3
Hello World from thread = 4
Hello World from thread = 6
Hello World from thread = 7


(a) The output is different each time the programs are executed. This is because the the OS schedules each process and thread differently each time they are executed.

(b) When the Mutexs are removed from the pthread program the output messages are interlived somewhat randomly. This is because the standard output statements are not atomic. The OS is interrupting the write statements randomly; each thread's messages are being put out in partially as they are interupped by the OS.  

Example output:
Hello World, from PThread Hello World, from PThread Hello World, from PThread 01
Hello World, from PThread 3
4
Hello World, from PThread 6
Hello World, from PThread 7
Hello World, from PThread 5
Number of threads = 8Hello World, from PThread 2

(c) When the Critical statements are removed from the OpenMPI program, as with the pthread version, the output message are intervlieved somewhat randomly. Again, this is because the standard output statements are not atomic. The OS is interrupting the write statements randomly; each thread's messages are being put out in partially as they are interupped by the OS.
 
Example output:
Hello World from thread = Hello World from thread = Hello World from thread = 321
Hello World from thread = 0
Number of Threads = 8
Hello World from thread = 5
Hello World from thread = 6
Hello World from thread = 7
Hello World from thread = 4

2) Hybrid MPI/PThread "hello, world" program.
