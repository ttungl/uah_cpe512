Problem # 1: Identify add_num_MPI.cpp limitations.

Limitation # 1: The code only works for data list sizes that are a multiple of the number of processors. That is, if the data list size is 10, then the number of processors has to be either 1, 2, or 5; if the number of processors is anything else then the code returns an incorrect summation.

Limitation # 2: The code dosen't take advantage of available MPI functions. That is, the code implements it's own scatter() and reduce() routines in leiu of simply using the MPI_scatter() and MPI_reduce() routines. 

Limitation # 3: The code dosen't come with unit tests.

Limitation # 4: The code uses memory ineffenctly: ranks 2-N needlesly allocate memory for the numbers array. 

Problem # 2: Create add_num_MPI_rv1.cpp to determine and report maximum and minimum numbers.

See the attached code. Here is the output:
