Problem # 1: Identify add_num_MPI.cpp limitations.

Limitation # 1: The code only works for data list sizes that are a multiple of the number of processors. That is, if the data list size is 10, then the number of processors has to be either 1, 2, 5 or 10; if the number of processors is anything else then the code returns an incorrect summation.

Limitation # 2: The code doesn't take advantage of available MPI functions. That is, the code implements it's own scatter() and reduce() routines in lieu of simply using the MPI_scatter() and MPI_reduce() routines. 

Limitation # 3: The code uses memory inefficiency: ranks 2-N needlessly allocate memory for the numbers array. 

Limitation # 4: The code doesn't come with unit tests.

Problem # 2: Create add_num_MPI_rv1.cpp to determine and report maximum and minimum numbers.

See the attached code. Here is the output:

$ mpirun -np 1 ./add_num_MPI_rv1.exe 2483
numbers matrix =
0
1
2
...
2480
2481
2482
Sum of numbers is 3081403
Minimum number is 0
Maximum number is 2482

Problem # 3: Create add_num_MPI_rv2.cpp to allow data list sizes to be something other than a multiple of the number of processors.

See the attached code. Here is the output for 12 processors with a data size of 2483:

$ mpirun -np 12 ./add_num_MPI_rv2.exe 2483
numbers matrix =
0
1
2
...
2480
2481
2482
Sum of numbers is 3081403
Minimum number is 0
Maximum number is 2482

The attached CMake file contains test that verify that the program works correctly from 2 to 16 processors for a number set size of 2483 numbers.

Problem # 4: Create add_num_MPI_rv3.cpp and replace the user written functions send_all_int(), scatter(), and reduce(), with equivalent collaborative communication routines from the MPI library.

See the attached code. Here is the output for 12 processors with a data size of 2483:

$ mpirun -np 12 ./add_num_MPI_rv3.exe 2483
numbers matrix =
0
1
2
...
2480
2481
2482
Sum of numbers is 3081403
Minimum number is 0
Maximum number is 2482

The attached CMake file contains test that verify that the program works correctly from 2 to 16 processors for a number set size of 2483 numbers.

Problem # 5: A multiprocessor consists of 100 processors, each capable of a peak execution rate of 200 Gflops. What is the performance of the system as measured in Gflops when 15% of the code is sequential and 85% is parallelization?

A performance factor can be determined using Amdahl's law.   

              p
   S(p) = --------
          1+(p-1)f

Where p is the number of processors and f is the fraction of the computation that cannot be divided into concurrent tasks.

Maximum performance is achieved when the sequential portion is 0%. For example:

              100
   S(p) = ---------- = 100
          1+(100-1)0

Then 100 x 200 Gflops = 20,000 Gflops.

When 15% of the code is sequential then we get a performance of 

               100
   S(p) = ------------ = 6.31
          1+(100-1).15

Then 6.31 x 200 Gflops = 1,262 Gflops.
