To run the programs, use the CMake script that is included in this directory.

CMake is installed in my $HOME directory at /home/uahcls19/local/bin 

The test.sh script in this directory will call CMake to build the Makefiles,
then run make to build the programs, then run make test to run through all
the test cases.
